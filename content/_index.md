## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

Hi! I am Long or Èæô, a Research Associate at the
[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://cii.aifb.kit.edu/)
and a Ph.D. Candidate at the
[Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/ii/home/).

My research explores AI accountability at the intersection of Information Systems, Computer Science, and Law.
I am particularly interested in the sociotechnical means to facilitate AI accountability for responsible use.

Before joining KIT and TUM, I gained experience as a Research Assistant at the
[University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/social-media-krasnova)
and as a Software Engineer in a HPC startup.

Beyond doing research, I love doing sports and exploring different cultures through both food and language.
My interest has resulted in me speaking five languages fluently (i.e., German, Vietnamese, English, French, Mandarin).

If you are interested in collaborating or want to chat, please
[contact](/contact) me.
