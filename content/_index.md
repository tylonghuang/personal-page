## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

I am Long Hoang Nguyen, a Research Associate at the
[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://cii.aifb.kit.edu/)
and a Ph.D. Candidate at the
[Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/ii/home/)
in Germany.
Before joining KIT and TUM, I gained experience as a Research Assistant at the
[University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/social-media-krasnova)
and as a Software Engineer in a HPC startup.

My research explores AI accountability at the intersection of Information Systems, Computer Science, and Law.
I am particularly interested in the socio-technical means to facilitate AI accountability for harm prevention.
